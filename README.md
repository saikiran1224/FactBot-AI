## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **FactBot AI**, a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to deliver comprehensive and rapid fact-checking capabilities. Built with the powerful CrewAI framework and presented through an intuitive Streamlit interface, FactBot AI takes a news article or topic as input, processes it through a network of specialized agents, and provides a concise **final verdict**, supported by **verified articles**, detailed **reasoning**, and actionable **recommendations**.

This intelligent application is engineered to bring clarity and accuracy to the information landscape, ensuring you receive well-substantiated insights along with transparency into the verification process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intelligent Multi-Agent System:** Leveraging CrewAI, FactBot AI orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents, each focusing on different aspects of fact-checking to ensure thorough and accurate analysis.
* **Comprehensive Output:** For every input, FactBot AI provides:
    * **Final Verdict:** A clear and concise judgment on the veracity of the input news/topic.
    * **Supporting Articles:** Links and summaries of verified sources that underpin the verdict.
    * **Detailed Reasoning:** A transparent explanation of how the verdict was reached, highlighting key findings from the agents.

* **Transparency & Metrics:**
    * **Sources Verified:** Clearly displays the number of external sources consulted and verified by the agents during the fact-checking process.
    * **Execution Time:** Provides the time taken for the entire fact-checking process, demonstrating the efficiency of the multi-agent architecture.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek, dark-themed Streamlit application designed for ease of use and optimal readability.
* **Rapid Processing:** Experience swift fact-checking, delivering comprehensive results in a minimal timeframe.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Dependencies

FactBot AI is built upon robust and modern technologies:

* **Python 3.8+** üêç: The core programming language.
* **CrewAI**: A cutting-edge Agentic AI Framework that powers the multi-agent architecture.
* **Streamlit** üåê: Provides the interactive and user-friendly web interface.

To run this project, ensure you have these installed.



## üîë API Credentials

FactBot AI relies on external APIs for its comprehensive fact-checking capabilities:

* **LLM Key (e.g., Gemini API Key):** Essential for the language model's reasoning and understanding.
    * Obtain your Gemini API Key by following the [instructions here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
* **Serper API Key:** Used for efficient and accurate web searching to gather supporting articles.
    * Create a free account at [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev) to obtain your API key.

Ensure these API keys are configured as environment variables or within a `.env` file for secure access.



## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run FactBot AI on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
